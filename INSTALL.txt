A) openSUSE 10.2
================

vym needs a newer version of Trolltechs Qt libraries than the one on the
10.2 installation media. This new version can be installed easily in
YaST:

	- Select "Installation Source"
	- Add a HTTP source:
		        Server: repos.opensuse.org
		     Directory: /KDE:/Qt/openSUSE_10.2/
		Authentication: Anonymous

	- Select "Software Management"
	- Search for "libqt4"
	- Install all found packages. (They have a version >= 4.3.0-55.1)

B) Mac OS X 10.3+
=================

After opening the disk image vym-1.9.0.dmg you can copy vym.app to
/Applications. This will need administrator rights.


This release of vym includes the Qt libraries. For more information on
Qt see http://www.trolltech.com.
